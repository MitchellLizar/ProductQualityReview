# ProductQualityReview
Practical HTML with Jquery/Javascript form for compliance with USFDA and GMP requirements for Annual Product Quality Reviews.

Download all of the files and maintain them in a single directory.
Double-click the HTML document.

The form should present the capabilities of self-expanding, multi-line (25) entries for ALL sections in ALL pages. It was developed
to interface with a database, which on this platform cannot be duplicated - therefor the fields will not .get nor display any values
other than the ones which are manually entered.
